		<h1>Tracking Progress</h1>
		<p>For 19 days, I will be learning HTML and CSS through the book, "HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites", by Jon Duckett.</p>
		<h2>Day One</h2>
		<p>Today I have learned about the basic structure of HTML in Chapter 1. This knowledge allowed me to create this page.
		   One thing that pique my interest the most is "attributes". For now, I only know about lang = "eng-us" for English language.
		   I'm looking forward to tomorrow!
		</p>
		<hr />
		<h2>Day Two</h2>
		<p>I have learned about the difference between <i>structural markup</i> and <i>semantic markup</i>. 
			<dfn>Structural markup</dfn> is about organizing contents. In contrast, <dfn>semantic markup</dfn> is giving purpose to 
			these contents.</p>
		<p><b>PRACTICE EXAMPLE:</b></p>
		<p><i>Writing Equations:</i>
		  <br />
		   <sup>2</sup> + 2x + 1 = 0
		  <br />
		   C + O<sub>2</sub> = CO<sub>2</sub></p>
		<p><i>Using strong and em tags:</i>
		  <br />
		   For <strong>important details</strong>. Could be for reminders, announcements, key takeaways, etc.
		  <br />
		   For changing the meaning of a sentence depending on the emphasis on words. For instance:
		  <br />
		   <em>I</em> like this - Who? Focuses on the person
		  <br />
		   I <em>like</em> this - Focuses on the feeling
		  <br />
		   I like <em>this</em> - Focuses on the object</p>
		<p><i>Using quotations:</i>
			<br />
			<blockquote cite="https://genius.com/Lea-salonga-and-brad-kane-a-whole-new-world-lyrics">I can show you the world
			<br />Shining, shimmering, splendid
			<br />Tell me, princess, now when did
			<br />You last let your heart decide?</blockquote>
			<br />
			<q>Do you wanna build a snowman?</q></p>
