		<h1>Tracking Progress</h1>
		<p>For 19 days, I will be learning HTML and CSS through the book, "HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites", by Jon Duckett.</p>
		<h2>Day One</h2>
		<p>Today I have learned about the basic structure of HTML in Chapter 1. This knowledge allowed me to create this page. One thing that pique my interest the most is "attributes". For now, I only know about lang = "eng-us" for English language. I'm looking forward to tomorrow!</p>
