        <p>I learned about links,<i>absolute link</i> and <i>relative link</i>. I organized my website by utilizing directories to implement the links. In this page, I will implement the remaining codes from Chapter 4. </p>

        <p><strong>Tips:</strong> Think of ../ as <i>Back</i>. For instance if you are in a grandchild folder, if you back, you'll be outside the grandchild folder but inside the child folder. If you back again, you'll be outside the child folder but inside the parent folder. If you are in a child folder and want to access another child folder, you have to ../child2. </p>

            <h3>GENERAL UPDATES</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Gifting
    <ul>
      <li>Due to popular demand, we are increasing the limit of gifts you can send to your friends from 5 to 10 gifts per day starting May 15. This change is going live when our Give Back // V25 Collection hits the Featured Storeâ€”so every gift from this bundle you send to a friend is also a gift to charity.</li>

<h3>MODES UPDATES</h3>

      <li>
        <em>Maximum ultimate point costs have gone up since Swiftplay launched, making it harder for some Agents to reach their ultimates. We've adjusted starting ultimate points to give you a better shot at using their ultimates within a half. This change is part of a broader Swiftplay update to scale starting ult points based on ultimate cost.</em>

<h3>BUG FIXES</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Cosmetics
    <ul>
      <li>
        In Patch 10.08, we fixed a visual bug that was found in the Bolt skinline that caused the skins to glow brighter than intended after equipping and inspecting the Bolt Flex.
        <ul>
          <li>We initially thought this bug could cause potential issues for photosensitive players. But after conducting extensive photosensitivity testing, we've concluded that there is no substantial risk. So we've decided to revert that bug fix and leave it as an Easter egg.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Fixed a bug where Kill Banners for certain skins (Oni, Evori Dreamwings, EX.O, Prelude to Chaos, Mystbloom, and more) were appearing smaller than normal after the first kill.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="bottom">KNOWN ISSUES</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Cosmetics
    <ul>
      <li>
        We're aware of a bug with the Bolt skinline that is causing the skins to glow far brighter than normal.
        <ul>
          <li>This is separate from the previous Bolt bug that was found, fixed, and reverted in this patch. This new bug causes Bolt skins to glow at an unacceptable brightness which could cause issues for photosensitive players and also affect competitive integrity.</li>
          <li>We will be fixing this bug with patch 10.11.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Agents
    <ul>
      <li>
        We're aware of an issue where Omen can enter his smoke targeting mode for Dark Cover, allowing dead allies to be able to see through Viper's Pit or other nearsight effects
        <ul>
          <li>We will be fixing this bug with patch 10.10</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
