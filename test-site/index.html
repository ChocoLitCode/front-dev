		<h1>My Daily Progress</h1>
		<p>For 19 days, I will be learning HTML and CSS through the book <cite>HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites</cite> by Jon Duckett. For each day, I will accomplish one book chapter. This website will contain the code implementation of what I have learned from the book.</p>
