Goal: Complete a website using HTML and CSS in 19 Days

This is the start of my front-end development journey. Coding advice is much appreciated.

Reference Book used:  HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites by Jon Duckett

The goal for each day corresponds to the content of each book chapter. 

For example:

Day 1 = Chapter 1: Structure

The book has 19 chapters. Therefore, I will be writing code for 19 days.
